# CSIT213 (Java) - Student Management System

---

### Project Overview
  >This repository contains a Java project designed to manage assignments, students, and subjects within an educational context. The system facilitates the enrollment of students in subjects and the association of assignments to those subjects.

### Features
- Enroll students and record their personal information and degree details.
- Create subjects with unique identifiers, titles, credits, and offering schools.
- Assign and manage assignments, including their due dates and total worth.

## How to Compile and Run
Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run Java applications. Open your command-line interface (CLI) and navigate to the project directory. Then follow the steps below:

1. Compile the Java code using the Java Compiler (`javac`):
   ```sh
   javac MainManagement.java
   ```
2. Run the compiled Java program using the Java Runtime Environment (`java`):
   ```sh
   java MainManagement
   ```

### Repository Structure
- `MainManagement.java`: Contains the main program execution and user interface for system interaction.
- `Student.java`: Defines the student class, with attributes and methods relevant to students.
- `Subject.java`: Defines the subject class, detailing subject-related information.
- `Assignment.java`: Manages assignment details associated with specific subjects.

### Scope
This project is related to UML class diagrams, Java classes’ definitions and implementations, arrays, Strings, and data input/output.
